# Singleton

## Intent

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Problem

The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the _Single Responsibility Principle_:

1. **Ensure that a class has just a single instance**. Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resource—for example, a database or a file. Here’s how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, you’ll get the one you already created.

Note that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular constructor since a constructor call must always return a new object by design.

2. **Provide a global access point to that instance**. Just like a global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code. <br> There’s another side to this problem: you don’t want the code that solves problem #1 to be scattered all over your program. It’s much better to have it within one class, especially if the rest of your code already depends on it.

## Solution

All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

- Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the _new_ operator with the Singleton class.
- Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.

## Aplicability

- **Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.**

- **Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables.**

## How to Implement

1. Add a private static field to the class for storing the singleton instance.
2. Declare a public static creation method for getting the singleton instance.
3. Implement “lazy initialization” inside the static method. It should create a new object on its first call and put it into the static field. The method should always return that instance on all subsequent calls.
4. Make the constructor of the class private. The static method of the class will still be able to call the constructor, but not the other objects.
5. Go over the client code and replace all direct calls to the singleton’s constructor with calls to its static creation method.

```ts
/**
 * The Singleton class defines the `getInstance` method that lets clients access
 * the unique singleton instance.
 */
class Singleton {
  private static instance: Singleton;

  /**
   * The Singleton's constructor should always be private to prevent direct
   * construction calls with the `new` operator.
   */
  private constructor() {}

  /**
   * The static method that controls the access to the singleton instance.
   *
   * This implementation let you subclass the Singleton class while keeping
   * just one instance of each subclass around.
   */
  public static getInstance(): Singleton {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
    }

    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  /**
   * Finally, any singleton should define some business logic, which can be
   * executed on its instance.
   */
  public someBusinessLogic() {
    // ...
  }
}

/**
 * The client code.
 */
function clientCode() {
  const s1 = Singleton.getInstance();
  const s2 = Singleton.getInstance();

  if (s1 === s2) {
    console.log('Singleton works, both variables contain the same instance.');
  } else {
    console.log('Singleton failed, variables contain different instances.');
  }
}

clientCode();
```

```
Singleton works, both variables contain the same instance.
```
