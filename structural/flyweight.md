# Flyweight

Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

## Problem

To have some fun after long working hours, you decided to create a simple video game: players would be moving around a map and shooting each other. You chose to implement a realistic particle system and make it a distinctive feature of the game. Vast quantities of bullets, missiles, and shrapnel from explosions should fly all over the map and deliver a thrilling experience to the player.

Upon its completion, you pushed the last commit, built the game and sent it to your friend for a test drive. Although the game was running flawlessly on your machine, your friend wasn’t able to play for long. On his computer, the game kept crashing after a few minutes of gameplay. After spending several hours digging through debug logs, you discovered that the game crashed because of an insufficient amount of RAM. It turned out that your friend’s rig was much less powerful than your own computer, and that’s why the problem emerged so quickly on his machine.

The actual problem was related to your particle system. Each particle, such as a bullet, a missile or a piece of shrapnel was represented by a separate object containing plenty of data. At some point, when the carnage on a player’s screen reached its climax, newly created particles no longer fit into the remaining RAM, so the program crashed.

## Solution

On closer inspection of the Particle class, you may notice that the color and sprite fields consume a lot more memory than other fields. What’s worse is that these two fields store almost identical data across all particles. For example, all bullets have the same color and sprite.

Other parts of a particle’s state, such as coordinates, movement vector and speed, are unique to each particle. After all, the values of these fields change over time. This data represents the always changing context in which the particle exists, while the color and sprite remain constant for each particle.

This constant data of an object is usually called the intrinsic state. It lives within the object; other objects can only read it, not change it. The rest of the object’s state, often altered “from the outside” by other objects, is called the extrinsic state.

The Flyweight pattern suggests that you stop storing the extrinsic state inside the object. Instead, you should pass this state to specific methods which rely on it. Only the intrinsic state stays within the object, letting you reuse it in different contexts. As a result, you’d need fewer of these objects since they only differ in the intrinsic state, which has much fewer variations than the extrinsic.

Let’s return to our game. Assuming that we had extracted the extrinsic state from our particle class, only three different objects would suffice to represent all particles in the game: a bullet, a missile, and a piece of shrapnel. As you’ve probably guessed by now, an object that only stores the intrinsic state is called a flyweight.

### Extrinsic data storage

Where does the extrinsic state move to? Some class should still store it, right? In most cases, it gets moved to the container object, which aggregates objects before we apply the pattern.

In our case, that’s the main Game object that stores all particles in the particles field. To move the extrinsic state into this class, you need to create several array fields for storing coordinates, vectors, and speed of each individual particle. But that’s not all. You need another array for storing references to a specific flyweight that represents a particle. These arrays must be in sync so that you can access all data of a particle using the same index.

A more elegant solution is to create a separate context class that would store the extrinsic state along with reference to the flyweight object. This approach would require having just a single array in the container class.

Wait a second! Won’t we need to have as many of these contextual objects as we had at the very beginning? Technically, yes. But the thing is, these objects are much smaller than before. The most memory-consuming fields have been moved to just a few flyweight objects. Now, a thousand small contextual objects can reuse a single heavy flyweight object instead of storing a thousand copies of its data.

### Flyweight and immutability

Since the same flyweight object can be used in different contexts, you have to make sure that its state can’t be modified. A flyweight should initialize its state just once, via constructor parameters. It shouldn’t expose any setters or public fields to other objects.

### Flyweight factory

For more convenient access to various flyweights, you can create a factory method that manages a pool of existing flyweight objects. The method accepts the intrinsic state of the desired flyweight from a client, looks for an existing flyweight object matching this state, and returns it if it was found. If not, it creates a new flyweight and adds it to the pool.

There are several options where this method could be placed. The most obvious place is a flyweight container. Alternatively, you could create a new factory class. Or you could make the factory method static and put it inside an actual flyweight class.

## Applicability

- Use the Flyweight pattern only when your program must support a huge number of objects which barely fit into available RAM.

## Example in TypeScript

```ts
/**
 * The Flyweight stores a common portion of the state (also called intrinsic
 * state) that belongs to multiple real business entities. The Flyweight accepts
 * the rest of the state (extrinsic state, unique for each entity) via its
 * method parameters.
 */
class Flyweight {
  private sharedState: any;

  constructor(sharedState: any) {
    this.sharedState = sharedState;
  }

  public operation(uniqueState): void {
    const s = JSON.stringify(this.sharedState);
    const u = JSON.stringify(uniqueState);
    console.log(`Flyweight: Displaying shared (${s}) and unique (${u}) state.`);
  }
}

/**
 * The Flyweight Factory creates and manages the Flyweight objects. It ensures
 * that flyweights are shared correctly. When the client requests a flyweight,
 * the factory either returns an existing instance or creates a new one, if it
 * doesn't exist yet.
 */
class FlyweightFactory {
  private flyweights: { [key: string]: Flyweight } = <any>{};

  constructor(initialFlyweights: string[][]) {
    for (const state of initialFlyweights) {
      this.flyweights[this.getKey(state)] = new Flyweight(state);
    }
  }

  /**
   * Returns a Flyweight's string hash for a given state.
   */
  private getKey(state: string[]): string {
    return state.join('_');
  }

  /**
   * Returns an existing Flyweight with a given state or creates a new one.
   */
  public getFlyweight(sharedState: string[]): Flyweight {
    const key = this.getKey(sharedState);

    if (!(key in this.flyweights)) {
      console.log(
        "FlyweightFactory: Can't find a flyweight, creating new one."
      );
      this.flyweights[key] = new Flyweight(sharedState);
    } else {
      console.log('FlyweightFactory: Reusing existing flyweight.');
    }

    return this.flyweights[key];
  }

  public listFlyweights(): void {
    const count = Object.keys(this.flyweights).length;
    console.log(`\nFlyweightFactory: I have ${count} flyweights:`);
    for (const key in this.flyweights) {
      console.log(key);
    }
  }
}

/**
 * The client code usually creates a bunch of pre-populated flyweights in the
 * initialization stage of the application.
 */
const factory = new FlyweightFactory([
  ['Chevrolet', 'Camaro2018', 'pink'],
  ['Mercedes Benz', 'C300', 'black'],
  ['Mercedes Benz', 'C500', 'red'],
  ['BMW', 'M5', 'red'],
  ['BMW', 'X6', 'white'],
  // ...

factory.listFlyweights();

function addCarToPoliceDatabase(
  ff: FlyweightFactory,
  plates: string,

  brand: string,
  model: string,
  color: string
) {
  console.log('\nClient: Adding a car to database.');
  const flyweight = ff.getFlyweight([brand, model, color]);

  // The client code either stores or calculates extrinsic state and passes it
  // to the flyweight's methods.
  flyweight.operation([plates, owner]);
}
