# Adapter

Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## Problem

Imagine that you’re creating a stock market monitoring app. The app downloads the stock data from multiple sources in XML format and then displays nice-looking charts and diagrams for the user.

At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-party analytics library. But there’s a catch: the analytics library only works with data in JSON format.

You could change the library to work with XML. However, this might break some existing code that relies on the library. And worse, you might not have access to the library’s source code in the first place, making this approach impossible.

## Solution

You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.

An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn’t even aware of the adapter. For example, you can wrap an object that operates in meters and kilometers with an adapter that converts all of the data to imperial units such as feet and miles.

Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate. Here’s how it works:

1. The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects.
2. Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapter’s methods.
3. Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the second object expects.

Sometimes it’s even possible to create a two-way adapter that can convert the calls in both directions.

Let’s get back to our stock market app. To solve the dilemma of incompatible formats, you can create XML-to-JSON adapters for every class of the analytics library that your code works with directly. Then you adjust your code to communicate with the library only via these adapters. When an adapter receives a call, it translates the incoming XML data into a JSON structure and passes the call to the appropriate methods of a wrapped analytics object.

## Applicability

- Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code.
- Use the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that can’t be added to the superclass.

## Code example

```ts
/**
 * The Target defines the domain-specific interface used by the client code.
 */
class Target {
  public request(): string {
    return "Target: The default target's behavior.";
  }
}

/**
 * The Adaptee contains some useful behavior, but its interface is incompatible
 * with the existing client code. The Adaptee needs some adaptation before the
 * client code can use it.
 */
class Adaptee {
  public specificRequest(): string {
    return '.eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS';
  }
}

/**
 * The Adapter makes the Adaptee's interface compatible with the Target's
 * interface.
 */
class Adapter extends Target {
  private adaptee: Adaptee;

  constructor(adaptee: Adaptee) {
    super();
    this.adaptee = adaptee;
  }

  public request(): string {
    const result = this.adaptee.specificRequest().split('').reverse().join('');
    return `Adapter: (TRANSLATED) ${result}`;
  }
}

/**
 * The client code supports all classes that follow the Target interface.
 */
function clientCode(target: Target) {
  console.log(target.request());
}

console.log('Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:');
const target = new Target();
clientCode(target);

console.log('');

const adaptee = new Adaptee();
console.log(
  "Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. See, I don't understand it:"
);
console.log(`Adaptee: ${adaptee.specificRequest()}`);

console.log('');

console.log('Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:');
const adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
clientCode(adapter);
```

```
Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:
Target: The default target's behavior.

Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. See, I don't understand it:
Adaptee: .eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS

Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:
Adapter: (TRANSLATED) Special behavior of the Adaptee.
```
