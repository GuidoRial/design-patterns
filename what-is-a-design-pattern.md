# What is a design pattern

**Design Patterns** are typical solutions to commonly ocurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

A design pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

## What does a design pattern consist of?

Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

- The **intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- The **motivation** further explains the problem and the solution that pattern makes possible.
- The **structure** of classes show each part of the pattern and how they are related
- A **code example** in TypeScript to make it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern

In addition to these components, design patterns can be categorized into three main types:

- **Creational Patterns**: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing ways to create objects in a manner suitable for a given situation. Examples of creational patterns include the Singleton pattern and the Factory pattern.

- **Structural Patterns**: Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects, emphasizing how they can be combined to form larger structures. Patterns such as the Adapter pattern and the Decorator pattern fall into this category.

- **Behavioral Patterns**: Behavioral patterns concentrate on the interaction between objects, defining communication patterns among them. Patterns like the Observer pattern and the Strategy pattern are examples of behavioral patterns.

By understanding these different types of patterns, you can leverage their capabilities to solve a wide range of design problems in software development.
